# Shade-Treatment-Effects-on-Cattle-Heat-Stress

Extensive semester-long individual research project exploring the effects of different shade structures on cattle heat stress. I performed everything from data sourcing, data cleaning and data curating, to interactive visualisations, statistical analyses and report writing. I was primarily supervised by Dr. Garth Tarr (Mathematics and Statistics, University of Sydney) and also guided by Dr. Angela Lees (Environmental and Rural Science, University of New England).

The project deliverables included a final report in the form of a journal article and a set of presentation slides.
